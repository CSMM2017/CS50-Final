We decided to create a 2D Platformer game, based on our favorite residential colleges (Silliman and Timothy Dwight). We made our game on the platform Unity, using C# code for all
the mechanics.

To load our game, you can download it off Xavier's GitHub profile here https://github.com/CSMM2017/CS50-Final . There you will be able to access the build to our game and
all of the code we used. To actually play the game, click on Build1.0.zip then click the download button next to the history button. Import it into the CS50 IDE by clicking
File-->Upload Local Files and then draggin the zip folder in. Execute the command "unzip Build1.0.zip" to unzip the file. CLick on the Build1.0/  file and then right click on index.html
and click preview. This will load up the game in the IDE. We recommend you use the popout option at the the top right and exit the IDE one. This will give you access to our game. (If you
would like to read through all our scripts, you can also download them from the same GitHub link, and upload the same way to the CS50 IDE.)

To play, simply click the buttons on the menu, and take the quiz. Because we could not draw and animate every of the 14 residential colleges, you can only play as Silliman or Timothy Dwight
for now. To check the results of the quiz, open up the console by right clicking on the screen next to the game and clicking inspect. Then click consol and it should be the 5th line from the
bottom.

To actually play the game, the controls are fairly easy. A to move left, D to move right, and W to jump and double jump. Traverse the course we have built for you by avoiding the
deadly crimson spikes as well as the terrible Psets. While the Psets can move and take three hits to kill you, the spikes only take one. Collect as many of Handsome Dan's Paw Prints as
you can, each is worth 50 points! Be careful, each time you die you lose 25. Go from checkpoint to checkpoint, marked by red flags, until you reach the finish Y. Explore the map, for there
are a few harder to find passages with more points in them!

Once you reach the end, there should be on ecstatic Handsome Dan waiting for you.
